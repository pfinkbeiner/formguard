# FormGuard v1.0
A powerful, customizable, quick and easy jQuery plugin to validate your forms.

## Usage
Ensure you have both the jQuery Core and the script integrated.

```
	<script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="assets/js/FormGuard.js"></script>
```

Activate FormGuard

```
	<script type="text/javascript">
		$(document).ready(function(){
   		   $("form.formguard").formguard();
		});
	</script>
```

Set your validators.

```
	<input type="text" data-validate="required" placeholder="Must be filled." />
	<input type="text" data-validate="email" placeholder="Must be a valid email address." />
	
	<input type="text" name="password" data-validate="required match[passwordconfirm] min[6]" />
	<input type="text" name="passwordconfirm" data-validate="required match[password]" />
```

## Validators
Apply your validators in `data-validate=""` attribute. You can combine them however you like. For example `data-validate="required number min[7]"` validates a required number with at least seven digits.

| key | description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `required` | Field must be filled or checkbox must be checked. |
| `min[X]` | Fields value must contains at least X characters. |
| `max[X]` | Fields value may not exceed X characters. |
| `email` | Fields value must be a valid email address. |
| `number` | Fields value must be a valid number. |
| `match[name]` | Fields value must match the value of the given fields value. For usage look at the given example (password & passwordconfirm). |

_Validators list will be continuously updatedâ€¦_

## Settings

| option       | type     | default  | description |
| -------------|:--------:| :-------:| ----------- |
| live		   | `boolean` | `true` | If `true` FormGuard validates each field on blur. |
| errorCls		| `string` | `'invalid'` | This class will be attached to every field which fails validation. |
| onFormError | `function` | not set | This callback fires when form validation fails. |
